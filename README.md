With the slowdown of Moore's law as we know it, the Cloud is resorting to heterogeneous, accelerated computing to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for performance and power efficiency. In just a few years, FPGAs have emerged as compute accelerators next to GPUs and are part of the standard offerings from many Cloud vendors. However, the development environment, deployment procedures, security measures, and monitoring tools are different for each platform and the portability of the FPGA kernel designs remains limited. 
In this workshop, leading platform providers and developers are going to present the state-of-the-art for Cloud FPGA platforms and explore opportunities and directions for future improvements from the developer's point of view. Instead of focusing on the performance and optimization of a specific application, the goal of this workshop is to highlight the challenges, which a Cloud application developer faces when designing, implementing, deploying and debugging Cloud services on Cloud FPGA platforms. One important aspect is portability and scalability of designs across different Cloud providers and target platforms.

## Organizers
**Gustavo Alonso, Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich, Switzerland**
Gustavo Alonso is a Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zürich where he is a member of the Systems Group (www.systems.ethz.ch) and the Head of the Institute for Computing Platforms. He has a degree in electrical engineering from the Madrid Technical University as well as a M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from UC Santa Barbara. Gustavo's research interests encompass almost all aspects of systems, from design to run time. He works on distributed systems, data processing, and system aspects of programming languages. Most of his research these days is related to data processing on data centers and the cloud as well as hardware acceleration using FPGAs. Gustavo has received numerous awards for his work, including four Test-of-Time awards for contributions to databases, programming languages, mobile computing, and systems. He is a Fellow of the ACM and of the IEEE as well as a Distinguished Alumnus of the Department of Computer Science of UC Santa Barbara.
 
**Chris Kachris, inaccel, Greece**
Chris Kachris the founder and CEO of InAccel that helps companies speedup their applications using hardware accelerators (FPGAs) in the cloud or on-prem. Inaccel, using a unique FPGA orchestrator, allows scalable deployment of FPGA clusters. Chris holds a Ph.D. from Delft University of Technology. He has published more than 70 papers in international journals and conferences with more than 1800 citations. He has over 15 years of experience on FPGAs and he is the editor of the book Hardware Accelerators in Data Centers.


**Christoph Hagleitner, IBM Research Europe, Switzerland**
Christoph Hagleitner leads the cloudFPGA project at the IBM Research Europe Lab (ZRL) in Ruschlikon, Switzerland. He obtained a Ph.D. degree for a thesis on CMOS-integrated Microsensors from ETH, Zurich, Switzerland in 2002. In 2003 he joined IBM Research to work on the system architecture of a novel probe-storage device (“millipede”-project). In 2008, he started to build up a new research group in the area of accelerator technologies. The team initially focused on integrated accelerator cores and gradually expanded its research to heterogeneous computing systems and their applications.


**Dionysios Diamantopoulos, IBM Research Europe, Switzerland**
Dionysios Diamantopoulos is a Post-Doc Researcher in the  Cloud & AI Systems Research department of IBM Research  Europe. Dionysios holds a PhD  from ECE/Technical University of Athens (2015), and a D.Eng. from CEID/University of Patras (2009). Being affiliated with the ICCS, he was enrolled in several research projects from EU (FP7, H2020) and European Space Agency.  Dionysios joined IBM ZRL (2017) as a researcher in Transprecision Computing. His research is disseminated in one book chapter and more than 30 publications in international conferences and journals. He is the co-inventor of  three filed patents and one pending (USPTO). His research interests lie in the system-level specialization that lay the foundation of heterogeneous-accelerated systems for the hybrid cloud era.  He is a member of HiPEAC, IEEE, IEEE CAS and Technical Chamber of Greece. 


**Burkhard Ringlein, IBM Research Europe, Switzerland**
Burkhard Ringlein is a Predoctoral Researcher in the Cloud & AI Systems Research department of the IBM Research Zurich Laboratory and pursues his PhD in cooperation with the Department of Computer Science, Computer Architecture of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany. As part of the cloudFPGA project, he is focusing on Distributed Reconfigurable Architectures in the context of High-Performance-Computing and AI Acceleration.
